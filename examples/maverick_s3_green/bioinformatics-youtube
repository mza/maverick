<%= titled 'What Can Bioinformaticians Learn from YouTube?' %>

I gave a talk at the <a href='http://www.sanger.ac.uk'>Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's</a> weekly Informatics group meeting today, on the 
subject of:<br /><br />

The talk is largely inspired by Carole Goble's BOSC keynote, <a href='http://www.slideshare.net/dullhunk/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-bioinformatics/'>The Seven Deadly Sins of Bioinformatics</a>, and touches on 
the differences in publishing and reusing data found in <a href='http://www.youtube.com'>YouTube</a> and commonly used Bioinformatics tools.
<br /><br />
We're planning on writing this up as a paper, but in the mean time, you can <a href='http://www.slideshare.net/mza/what-can-bioinformaticians-learn-from-youtube'>download the slides here</a>.
By the by, <a href='http://www.slideshare.net'>Slideshare</a> is also an excellent example of the sort of data, code and service resuse that we could do with more of in scientific software.
