<%= titled 'RailsConf Europe: Keynote' %>

RailsConf kicked of, like, for reals here in Berlin this evening, with an excellent keynote from Dave Thomas. 
<br /><br />
Dave spoke about the art of software engineering (and the engineering of software art), and made a plea for developers to start
building beautiful apps. Hear hear.
<br /><br />
Personally, I've often felt that development work was not unlike sculpture: it requires a focus on tiny details whilst maintaining an 
appreciation of the <i>thing</i> as a whole. Dave Thomas compared it to various other artistic pursuits: poetry, writing, painting, focusing
on what developers can learn. Modular design, rapid prototyping, giving the client what they need: there is nothing you can't throw at the metaphor.
<br /><br />
One final point really stood out: that developers should sign our work as an artist would a painting: I'm definitely going to be promoting this on my return to the lab. Not only does this fits nicely in to the humane approach advocated by Kathy Sierra and 
Aza Raskin, but it also encourages developers to take ownership, nay, pride in their work. Fantastic.
