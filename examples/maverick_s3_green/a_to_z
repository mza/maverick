<%= titled 'Developing for the web: slides' %>

	I gave a talk today at the <a href='http://www.sanger.ac.uk'>Sanger Institute</a> to kick off our Autumn talk series. 
	<br /><br />
	I spoke about developing for the web, introducing an A to Z of web app techniques, technology and jargon. It starts at
	<i>ajax</i>, meanders through <a href='microformats.org'>microformats</a> and finishes up at the <a href='http://www.csszengarden.com'>Zen Garden</a>.

	My thanks to <a href='http://www.slideshare.net'>Slideshare</a> for picking up the slides and featuring them on their home page as part
	of their first birthday party. Zing!
