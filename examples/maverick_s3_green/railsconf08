<p>
	After a busy week, I'm preparing to head off to Portland, Oregan for this year's RailsConf. Myself and a few colleagues from 
	the software teams at the <a href='http://www.sanger.ac.uk'>Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> will be flying out on Wednesday, ready to get started on Thursday morning.
</p>
<p>
	With the full line up published, here are some of the sessions that have piqued my interest.
