<p>
	<a href='http://www.greenisgood.co.uk/pages/show/checklist'>Simple checklists</a> can be a great way to organise development tasks and prepare for automation. 
</p>
<p>
	But what makes up a good checklist?
	<ul>
		<li>1. Keep it simple: the more complex, the less likely it will require to follow and the less likely it is to stick.</li>
		<li>2. No more than 5 items</li>
		<li>3. Keep it flexible: bump less important items as necessary</li>
		<li>4. Merge related items into automated, single list items</li>
		<li>5. Share it: chances are that others can benefit too</li>
	</ul>
