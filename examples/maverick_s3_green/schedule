<p>
	The full schedule for this year's <a href='http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home'>RailsConf</a> has just been <a href='http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/grid'>posted online</a>.

	And, of course, pencil in 11.45 on Sunday 1st June for my talk, <a href='http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/detail/1846'>Genomes on Rails</a>. In fact, forget the pencil, you can go right ahead and commit yourself in ink. <code>: )</code>
