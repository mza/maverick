<%= titled 'RailsConf Europe: Tuesday' %>

RailsConf is in full swing here in Berlin. <a href='http://www.loudthinking.com'>David Heinemeier Hansson</a> gave the keynote
address this morning, focusing on some of the extra syntactic sugar to be found in Rails 2.0, the first preview release of which
should make an appearance online over the next few days.
<br /><br />
Some good stuff in there: namespaced controllers, HTTP basic authentication and an extension of the <code>responds_to</code> block which 
now separates out the mime type from the renderer. This could mean some migration troubles for some (templates are now named <code>index.html.erb</code>, for example), but the
additional flexibility of customising responses by type seems worth it. DHH shows a demo that added a custom response type for the iPhone, for example.
<br /><br />
Moreover, David advocated a much more mature approach to Rails evangelism: after three years, the doors to Rails are now well and truly open. Many of the original stumbling blocks
have been removed (<code>script/server</code> couldn't be easier, for example), which means that we should now be able to ease off on the schtick, and allow the framework to attract
users on it's own merits. Existing Rails developers also get back and start enjoying the framework, instead of non-stop
evangelism.
