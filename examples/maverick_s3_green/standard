<%= titled 'Raising the Standard' %>

	<p>
		Following on from my <a href='http://localhost:3000/pages/show/a_to_z'>recent talk</a>, I got to thinking
		about the key areas those involved in developing applications for the web should concentrate on to build
		truly outstanding apps.
	</p>
	
	<h1>Front and center</h1>
	<div class='callout'>
		what can <i>developers</i>
		do to make outstanding apps for <i>fellow developers</i>?
	</div>
	<p>
		Clearly, the primary goal of any application (on the web, on your desktop, on your iPhone) is to solve a problem
		on behalf of its users. In this article, I'd like to take that as a given, and focus on the flip side: in an area of science in which
		collaboration is virtually guaranteed, what can <i>developers</i>
		do to make truly outstanding apps for their <i>fellow developers</i>?
	</p>
	<p>
		Three things come to mind: maintenance, maintenance and maintenance. Picking up someone else's code is always a bit of a 
		nighmare. Doubly so if that code is a 6000 line Perl script with no comments. Quadruply so if that code has fallen over
		taking down the web site you've just had published. We've all been there, folks: <i>ouch.</i>	
	</p>
	<div class='callout'>
		Reliable code makes for happy developers
	</div>
	
	<p>
		Reliable code that's easy to read, easy to update and easy to test makes for happy developers. Happy because they know where to start, happy because they know what to change, and happy that their changes will continue to work well. With that in mind, I present
		the <b>Web Standards</b>: three levels of <i>achievement</i> aimed at bringing maintainability and reliability to web app development, and keeping a smile
		on your team's face. Future generations will thank you too.

	</ul>	
	<p>
		None of these are technically difficult: a few minutes of diligence today can help save <s>hours</s>, <s>days</s>, months of anguish
		tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of the web apps I'm currently working on score a solid Bronze (this one being a notable exception: the templates don't validate): but I hope this will give myself and
		others something to push for.
