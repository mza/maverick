<%= titled 'Scrum for Project Leaders' %>

<p>To make Scrum work, it requires buy-in from the various project leaders a software development team might work with.</p>
<p>I recently gave a small lunch time talk here at the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> to project leaders who work with the production software team to explain the benefits of the Scrum approach, and what it meant for them going forward. My slides are here.<br />

<p>The talk went well - with all the project leaders present agreeing to give it a try. One of Scrum&#8217;s major advantages when seeking support (over more general &#8216;agile&#8217; approaches, even) is that every aspect can be time boxed. If Scrum fails for some reason, the relatively short development sprint means that the actual cost of the failure is low.</p>
