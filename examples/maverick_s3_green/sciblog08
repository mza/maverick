<%= titled 'Science Blogging 2008' %>

<p>
	For those of you not already <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/30004057@N04/sets/72157607004721184/'>drinking</a> in the sights and sounds of London's science based pubs, <a href='http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html'>Science Blogging 2008</a> starts tomorrow in London.
</p>
<p>
	The first of its kind in the UK, the conference aims to bring together scientific bloggers to discuss the approaches, benefits and pitfalls of blogging in the scientific domain. <a href='http://www.badscience.net/'>Ben Goldacre</a> is keynoting, with other sessions starring Nature's very own <a href='http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/'>Maxine</a> and <a href='http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/euan'>Euan</a>, along with open notebook afficionado, <a href='http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/'>Jean-Claude Bradley</a>. There is also a round of unconference style sessions in the afternoon, which are always interesting.
</p>
<p>
	I'll be heading down to London tomorrow, and will be speaking on microblogging in science: part introduction, part discussion on the communities built around microblogging services in science: I'm very much looking forward to it.
