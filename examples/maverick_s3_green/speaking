<p>
	I've just heard that I'll be speaking at this year's <a href='http://www.railsconf.com'>RailsConf</a> in Portland! I've been given 45 minutes to wax lyrical on how
	Ruby and Rails are helping us stay agile and keep up with the furious rate of change of the next generation sequencing platform at the <a href='http://www.sanger.ac.uk'>Sanger Institute</a>, during my session, <a href='http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/detail/1846'>Genomes on Rails</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Many thanks to the organisers of RailsConf, it's a real honour to share the same stage with the likes of <a href='http://hivelogic.com/'>Dan Benjamin</a>, 
	<a href='http://brainspl.at'>Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a>, <a href='http://errtheblog.com/'>Chris Wanstrath</a> and <a href='http://www.37signals.com'>Ryan Singer</a>.
