		The second Barcamp to take place in Cambridge is fast approaching! All are welcome to attend, contribute and discuss topics at the interface of science and technology at <a href='http://barcamp.org/BarCamb-2'>Barcamb 2</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The timings are in place, the rooms are booked, the refreshments have been ordered and a few early talk suggestions have been posted to the wiki. Those planning to attend are welcome to add their own before the day.
	</p>
	<p>
		As with last year, we'll kick things off with breakfast at the Genome Campus, before introducing ourselves with a classic Barcamp 3-word introduction. The schedule for the day will be put up on our trusty whiteboard: and away we go. One of the
		most exciting things about a Barcamp is the unexpected meetings and associations that spring up over the course of the day: fresh ideas, fresh perspectives, fresh approaches.
	</p>
	<p>
		Very much looking forward to it.
